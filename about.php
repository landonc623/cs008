        <p>Welcome to Picture Studios! We believe that every photo tells a story, and because of that, it is our mission to provide the upmost quality of photos for every occasion. 
           Founded in November of 1990, we have over 25 years in the photography industry, and our talented photographers really display our years if experience! Located in Burlington
           Vermont, we are a local small business with around 10 employees, ranging from concert to wedding photography. We can do small and large events, and also videography for a 
           variety of ceremonies. Our company also does senior portraits and family portraits as well. 

How we Were Founded:
As said above, we were founded 28 years ago in November of 1990. We initially started with just one photographer, and grew to now have fifteen photographers employed! 
Our founder, Tina Belcher, enjoyed photographing customers at her fathers' burger restaurant. Tina at her local high school would take pictures at all of the sporting
events, and even took some Senior photos of her fellow classmates. Originally from Ocean City, New Jersey, Tina decided to move to Vermont and attend UVM, graduating 
in 1988 with her degree in Photography from the Department of Art and Art History. Once she realized she loved Burlington too much to leave, she decided to start up her
own small business, Picture Studios, in Burlington Vermont. 

What Photographing We Do:
All our photographers are specialized in one event, but have the skill and talent to do any event assigned to them. We can do a multitude of different occasions, 
ranging from:

- Weddings
- Birthdays
- Graduations
- Proms
- Concerts
- Senior Portraits
- Family Portraits
- Corporate Events

Our Photography Style:
After over 25 years in the industry, we have perfected our style and quality of our images. At all of our events, we remain outside of the occasion, saving the
spotlight for our customers and capturing the day as it goes. In portraits, we will take our time with you, allowing you to see the images as we take them and 
decide on what you like and dislike. We also shoot in a variety of locations for portraits, from our studio which is decked out with decorations including a 
Christmas tree and a fake living room, to your own home or outside. 

How Many Photos Should I Expect to Receive:
Your should expect receive around 100-200 photos for larger events, including corporate events and weddings. For portrait style, we have different packages with
differing amount and types of photos. On average we take around 1,000-2,000 photos at large events, but after editing out duplicates, odd expressions, and images
that do not meet our standards for lighting and quality, we end up with about 100 fully finished images. 

When Should I Expect To See My Photos:
Depending on the size of the event and the amount of photos taken, you should expect to see your photos done 6 to 8 weeks after the event. For portraits, you
should expect to see them 2-3 weeks after being taken, sometimes longer depending on if itâ€™s the holiday season. </p>
